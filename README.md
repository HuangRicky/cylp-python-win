# cylp-python-win
cylp python windows binary

cylp is a Python package: 
https://pypi.org/project/cylp
https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP
License: CPL v1.0

I compiled under Windows 64bit Python 2.7 using MinGW-64 (gcc 4.8.3), 
because the original authors only compiled under Python 3+:
https://pypi.org/project/cylp/0.9.0b1/#files
and under Python 2.7, only 32 bit is available.
https://pypi.org/project/cylp/0.7.4/#files

For your convenience, I also copied Python 3+ binaries.
